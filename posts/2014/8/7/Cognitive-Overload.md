Recently I have been having some issues managing multiple projects.  In the past, I have normally only worked on one project at a time.  Managing a task list for one project was pretty simple and I could store most of my plans mentally.  I could easily break down my project into small chunks and keep track of these pieces with ease.  There was always a bit of overhead managing these tasks, though, and I'd frequently think about them hours after the work day ended.  While not optimal, I was able to keep all of my tasks in order.

Within the past two months, I have heavily been working on a second project.  The second project came with the same organizational tasks I had used in the past.  I soon noticed that I was frequently context switching mentally between both projects.  There was a passive piece of my brain being reserved to manage each project.  I frequently lost my concentration and wasn't really sure what was happening.

Once I noticed that juggling multiple projects was causing me trouble I decided to take action.  I have dabbled with [OmniFocus][of] in the passed but I unfortunately never used it enough to form a habit.  I decided to break out OmniFocus again to see if it would set my mind in order.  Within a few days I began to notice a difference.  My mind was frequently clear and I was able to concentrate on tasks more deeply.  Getting the management of my projects out of my head freed up the latent job of keeping my tasks in order.  I hope I can make this habit stick -- it's great to have a clear head.

The nerd-realization that I had in this process is that my brain is like a CPU.  I have limited resources and too many context switches are bad!
