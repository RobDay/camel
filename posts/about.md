Hi everyone.  My name is Rob Day and I am an iOS developer based out of the NYC area.  While I work as a full time iOS developer, I also enjoy playing with a bunch of different language (python and javascript being my current distractions).

This blog is powered by [camel][c] which was written by [Casey Liss][cl].  I've made some minor changes to the blogging engine to make publishing posts a bit easier. I figured it would be a fun experiment to create a blog with camel and have full control over the blog.
